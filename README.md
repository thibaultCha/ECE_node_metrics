2. `./bin/populate` it should output the created users and their metrics

3. `make run` run the server

4. `make test` run the tests

### Features

- 30 minutes sessions tolerent to server restart
- Access to a user's metrics if authenticated (and not other users' metrics)

### Other personal work with Node.js

Strictly for personal reasons, here are some of my recent work on Node.js on which I think you might be interested to have a look:

**[Reminders](https://github.com/thibaultCha/Reminders)**, the small project Mashape gave me to do for an internship position. I think it's really close to this assignment and to the Node.js course. Maybe it can inspire you for the future lessons.

**[Equiprose](http://www.equiprose.org/)**, a static website and blog generator I built for my website. It's fast, customizable and powerful. It uses Jade and Stylus for templating.

**[node-recursive-search](https://github.com/thibaultCha/node-recursive-search)**, you once said that if you have on function that is not on npm, we should make a plugin for that, so this is a function I needed in Equiprose. There is a bigger plugin for objects manipulation too, not published yet.
